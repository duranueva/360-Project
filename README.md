# 360-Project. 

This is a project that manages data from Evaluation Centers (Centros Evaluadores), which offer courses and certify their students. The 360 comes because I created all the components of this project. From the architecture and database design to the backend and frontend implementation. Ready to scale from the start. 

In the future, i will launch to a server and add more components.
